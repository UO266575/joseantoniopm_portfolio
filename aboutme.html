        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I am an energetic and active person with 11 years of experience playing basketball, which has helped to
            instill a strong sense of discipline and teamwork in me.
            During the COVID-19 pandemic, I further developed my leadership, problem-solving, and effective
            communication skills by volunteering with the Red Cross, where I worked (and still do) with a diverse and
            caring team. This experience has made me a more well-rounded individual, and has allowed me to contribute
            positively to the community. I am eager to transfer these skills to my professional career and continue to
            learn and add value to the projects I join.</p>

                <p>During the academic year 21/22, I had the opportunity to do an Erasmus programme in Kaunas,
                    Lithuania, at the Kauno technologijos universitetas. During my stay, I lived with people from
                    different cultures from which I learned a lot.
                    Erasmus helped me to develop my adaptability to change and improve my personal management skills.
                    It was an enriching experience that broadened my horizons. In addition, the stimulating academic
                    environment and a different approach to education contributed to my academic growth.</p>

                    I collaborate with the Red Cross as I said at the beginning, in various projects, including the
                    following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Emergency Immediate Response Team (ERIE) for Provisional Shelter. As part of this team, we respond to
                        situations requiring immediate action by setting up temporary shelters or management points during emergencies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ERIE for Psychosocial Intervention. We provide psychological support in emergency situations, aiming to offer
                        comfort and assistance to those affected by providing a listening ear and counseling services.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Olas de frío" project. This initiative involves going out on nights when the temperature drops below 5°C to
                        distribute blankets, hot chocolate, and pastries to homeless people on the streets, aiming to provide warmth
                        and some comfort during harsh weather conditions.
                    </li>
